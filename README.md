## [Project 4: ML-Project-for-Online-Music-Store]
* Built a machine learning project for an online music store that recommends the music albums, that users are likely to buy
* Built the model, trained it, tested the model and evaluated the accuracy
* In this ML project, I have used DecisionTreeClassifier alogarithm
* Persisted the model, so in the future, there is no need to build and train an already trained model cause training a model is time consuming especially if we are dealing with a large dataset consisting of millions of records in it. We can directly load the model and ask it to make predictions.
